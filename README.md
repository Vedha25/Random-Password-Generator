# Random-Password-Generator
The program allows users to create a specified number of passwords, each of a user-defined length. It uses a predefined pool of characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols, to ensure variability and security. The core logic of the password generation employs the random.choice() method to select characters randomly from the pool, assembling them into secure and unpredictable passwords.<br>

Additionally, the program is interactive, prompting users to input the number of passwords and their desired length, then outputs the generated passwords for easy access. Its straightforward structure and functionality make it a useful tool for ensuring strong password security
